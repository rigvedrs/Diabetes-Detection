Simple model involving Neural Network
I have just experimented with different types of neural networks to check where overfitting can occur. 
First, I tried out the model with 2 hidden layer with 20 neurons each. Then moved on to deeper ones with more hidden layers and greater number of neurons.
There was an immediate increase in the noise in accuracy.
